This is a simple implementation of a file transfer client, written in pure Go. What's novel about this system is the use of Fountain codes (currently via the Luby Transform) in data transmission. For those of you unfamiliar with Fountain Codes, they are a simple method of transmitting information that allows one to regenerate a file without receiving every packet and without the use of packet reception ACK's. Currently this is implemented via UDP, however it is better suited for a broadcast medium where packet loss or corruption is high and there exists no return channel to signal the source to retransmit information. Realisitically, this isn't a great file transfer solution, however it's a fun project to work on and an interesting concept. Definitely worth a look if you're interested in network programming with Go as well.
